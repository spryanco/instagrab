# instagrab :camera:
A lightweight WordPress plugin for displaying your Instagram feed ready to be styled. Essentially does what it says on the tin.

## About
I produced this one night while creating https://lucaregan.co.uk to showcase photos from an Instagram feed. It does not come pre-styled but
can be made the way you like through styling the `.instagrab-stream` class (the wrapper) or individual img elements `.instagrab`. 

## Installation
Download instagrab.php and put it into a squeeky clean directory named `instagrab`. Upload this directory to the `wp-content/plugins` directory of your
Wordpress installation. 

Enjoy!
